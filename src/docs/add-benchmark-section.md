# Instructions to Add Benchmark Section to SUNO-CHEATSHEET.html

Due to the size of the SUNO-CHEATSHEET.html file, here are step-by-step instructions to add the benchmark templates section:

## Step 1: Add Navigation Link

Find the navigation menu in the HTML file. Look for the `<nav>` element or `.nav-container` class, and add this link:

```html
<a href="#benchmark-templates" class="nav-link">Benchmark Templates</a>
```

## Step 2: Add Benchmark Section

1. Find the end of the content sections of the document, before the closing `</main>` tag
2. Insert the entire contents of the `benchmark-section.html` file there

## Step 3: Add CSS Styles

1. Find the `<style>` section in the head of the document
2. Add the CSS styles from `benchmark-section.html` (the portion marked "Add this to the <style> section")

## Step 4: Add JavaScript

1. Find the `<script>` section at the end of the document
2. Add the JavaScript from `benchmark-section.html` (the portion marked "Add this to the <script> section")

## Verification

After adding the section:
1. Check that the navigation link works
2. Verify the tab switching functionality works
3. Test the copy button functionality
4. Ensure the responsive design works on different screen sizes

## Content Organization

The benchmark templates are organized in a tabbed interface with:
- Minimal Control template
- Standard Control template
- Advanced Control template

Each template uses the exact same lyrics but with increasing levels of formatting control, making them ideal for benchmarking Suno against other AI music services with a consistent baseline.

The templates are designed to be adaptable to other services with different tag systems while maintaining the same core content.
