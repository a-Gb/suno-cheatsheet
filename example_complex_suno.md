[Intro]
[Fade In]
*rainfall*
[Orchestral]
Haunting piano notes echo in darkness
Strings slowly emerge from silence
[Dynamic Complex Progression]

[Verse 1]
[Female Vocal]
[Vulnerable]
Memories fade into shadows
Time stands still in this empty room
Whispers of what once was
Echo through the halls of my mind

[Chorus]
[Intensify]
LOST IN THE ECHOES OF TIME
Searching for what we left behind
LOST IN THE ECHOES OF TIME
(Will we ever find our way?)

[Bridge]
[Spoken Word]
[Rubato]
We construct elaborate memories
Only to watch them dissolve like morning mist
[Accelerando]
Faster and faster they slip away
Until nothing remains but feeling

[Outro]
[Female Vocal]
[Whisper]
Time moves on...
Whether we're ready or not
*distant thunder*
[Decrescendo]
[Fade Out]
[End]
