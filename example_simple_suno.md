[Intro]
(gentle acoustic guitar melody)

[Verse 1]
[Female Vocal]
Morning light through autumn leaves
Memories of days gone by
Whispers of a changing season
In the cool September sky

[Chorus]
Time keeps flowing like a river
Carrying us along
Through the valleys and the mountains
Where we all belong

[Verse 2]
[Female Vocal]
Footprints fade on sandy shores
As waves wash them away
Nothing truly lasts forever
But love finds a way to stay

[Chorus]
Time keeps flowing like a river
Carrying us along
Through the valleys and the mountains
Where we all belong

[Outro]
(gentle acoustic guitar fading)
[End]
